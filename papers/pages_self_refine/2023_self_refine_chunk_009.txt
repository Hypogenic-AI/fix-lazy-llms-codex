I Beyond Benchmarks
SELF -REFINE demonstrates its iterative feedback and refinement capabilities in the context of
website layout generation. ChatGPT initially produces a rudimentary layout for a given topic, and
then uses the FEEDBACK to suggest specific, actionable improvements, as demonstrated in Figures 7
and 9. These suggestions range from design changes such as color and font adjustments, to content
enhancements and layout modifications. Figures 8 and 10 showcase the final layouts, post-feedback
implementation, highlighting the potential and versatility of SELF -REFINE across different scenarios.
