# Why is this code slow?
# This code is slow because it is using a brute force approach to find the square
root of the input number. It is looping through every possible number
starting from 0 until n. Note that the sqare root will be smaller than n, so
at least half of the numbers it is looping through are unnecessary. At most,
you need to loop through the numbers up to the square root of n.
