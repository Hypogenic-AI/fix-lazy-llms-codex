Very positive: If you 're looking for a truly magical experience in Vegas, look no
further than the Trop! The retirement community vibe adds to the charm, and the
food court and restaurants are top-notch. The free Folies Bergere show is a real
treat and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. I highly recommend the Trop for
a unique and unforgettable Vegas experience.
Rewrite this review to have a Positive sentiment.
Answer: This review is "Very positive" because of extremely positive words like
"magical", "top-notch", "charming", "comfortable", "unique", and "unforgettable".
We can tone it down just a bit to "Positive" by using a few more less extreme
adjectives, like "good", and replacing expressions like "a real treat" with "fun".
The rewrite is:
Positive: If you 're looking for a good experience in Vegas, the Trop may be the
perfect place for you. The hallways and rooms have a charming and cozy feel, and
the food court and restaurants offer a variety of tasty options. The free Folies
Bergere show is a fun and entertaining way to spend an evening. Overall, it 's a
great value and an enjoyable stay.
Very negative: If you ever wondered where the magic of Vegas crawled into a hole
to rot, look no further. Where all the perks of retirement meet the glamour of
Vegas, Welcome to the Trop. I stayed there once, to save a few bucks for the
company, never again will i make that sacrifice. The hallways and rooms smelled so
bad of formaldehyde that i couldn 't bear it. Their food court and restaurants are
terrible. The free Folies Bergere show is lame. The rooms look like a retirement
community from florida. steer clear if you can!

Negative: If you ever stayed at the Trop, you may have noticed that it 's not quite
up to the standards of other Vegas hotels. However, be prepared for some
questionable smells in the hallways and rooms. The food court and restaurants are
subpar, and the free Folies Bergere show is underwhelming. The rooms have a
retirement community feel to them. Overall, it 's not the best option, but it may
work in a pinch.
Why is this review not Very positive?
Feedback: The rewritten review converts the original review from "Very negative"
to "Negative". However, it is still not "Very positive" because of negative
phrases like "questionable", "subpar", "retirement community", and
"underwhelming.". To make it "Very positive", we need to do a lot more work. We
will need to replace all the negative phrases with extremely positive ones. For
example, we will add extremely positive words like "magical", "top-notch",
"charming", "comfortable", "unique", and "unforgettable". Try again!
Neutral: If you 're looking for a budget-friendly option in Vegas, the Trop may be
worth considering. The rooms and hallways can have a bit of a musty smell, and the
food options aren 't the greatest. The Folies Bergere show is free, but it 's not
the most exciting. Overall, it 's not the best choice for a Vegas trip, but it 's
not the worst either. Just keep your expectations in check.

Trop may be the perfect place for you. The hallways and rooms have a charming and
